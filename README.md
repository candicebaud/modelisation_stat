This repository contains the work done for the course 'Séminaire de modélisation statistique' (ENSAE). The project was made in collaboration with Marc Lavielle (Ecole Polytechnique, INRIA). 
The goal was to implement the model described in Marc Lavielle's paper (https://jdssv.org/index.php/jdssv/article/view/48) enabling to detect discontinuities in the second derivative of the number of cases (covid-19), to be able to track the pandemic's evolution.
